Problems I faced while working with docker:-

1) Any docker command was asking me sudo previllege.
=> cmd 1) compgen -g  (Check if docker group is present or not)

      if docker group is not present
   cmd 2.1) sudo groupadd docker
      else
   cmd 2.2) DO NOTHING

   cmd 3) sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker (specify which user is using docker commands)

   cmd 4) newgrp docker (to reinstantiate env or simply logout and login)

   Now you should be able to use docker commands without sudo
